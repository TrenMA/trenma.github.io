### Informative Covariates, False Discoveries and Mutual Fund Performance
*with Po-Hsuan Hsu, Ioannis Kyriakou, Georgios Sermpinis*

*(Reject and resubmit, Journal of Econometrics)*

**<font size="3">  Abstract: </font>**  <font size="3"> We introduce a novel multiple hypothesis testing method named the functional False Discovery Rate “plus” (fFDR+). The method incorporates informative covariates (and new information they carry) in estimating the False Discovery Rate (FDR) of predictive models’ “conditional” performance. In our simulation based on mutual fund returns, the fFDR+ controls well the FDR and gains considerable power over prior methods that do not account for extra information. Its advantage remains under different alpha distributions, balanced and unbalanced data structure, and cross-sectional dependent and independent error terms. It is also robust to estimation errors in the covariates. In further empirical analyses, we construct portfolios based on several covariates (five well-known and four new ones) and show that they enhance the performance of mutual fund portfolios, highlighting the value of extra information in the multiple hypothesis testing framework.

### Picking Hedge Funds with High Confidence
*with Ioannis Psaradellis, Georgios Sermpinis*

**<font size="3">  Abstract: </font>** <font size="3">  This paper introduces a new procedure to control for family error rate (FWER) in picking out-performers. The method utilizes multiple side information to more precisely estimate the FWER and gains much higher power in detecting out-performers compared to existing ones. In assessing hedge fund performance context, the new method allows investors picking out-performing funds with high confidence, that is, with very low FWER. The yearly rebalancing portfolios of hedge funds constructed by the new method with use of available covariates beat passive benchmarks in various settings. Our further experiments show that the new method detects truly out-performing hedge fund managers who can repeat their past performance over a long horizon.
