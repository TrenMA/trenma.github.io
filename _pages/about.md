I am Tren Ma, a PhD candidate in Financial Econometrics at the University of Glasgow. Prior to joining the PhD, I completed my BSc degree in Mathematics at Hanoi National University of Education and a MRes in Economics at the University of Glasgow.

My research interests lie in financial econometrics and the applications of machine learning techniques in financial trading and investment. I have presented my research at some major finance conferences such as American Finance Association, Financial Management Association annual meetings and China International Conference in Finance.

### Controlling for Luck in Picking Outperforming Trading Strategies

**<font size="3">  Abstract: </font>** <font size="3"> 
This paper develops a new framework to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) using informative covariates, namely, the multivariate functional false discovery rate (mfFDR). The method gains a considerably higher power than the one that utilizes only one covariate and the ones that use only p−values. This advantage is robust under various settings of dependencies and estimation errors that are typical in economic and financial data. In further empirical analyses, the method is applied to detecting truly profitable trading rules from a large and widely used universe of technical trading rules in the foreign exchange market. Particularly, four informative covariates are introduced and analyzed. The mfFDR using the four covariates detects many more profitable rules than existing methods regardless of the group of currencies and sample periods. The portfolios of trading rules selected by mfFDR produce significantly positive net Sharpe ratios which are higher than those of portfolios selected by the existing methods. More importantly, the more covariates being used the higher Sharpe ratio the portfolios gain. Finally, via analyzing profitability of the technical rules conditionally on their category, useful insights on the use of the technical rules in practice are uncovered.

### Informative Covariates, False Discoveries and Mutual Fund Performance
*with Po-Hsuan Hsu, Ioannis Kyriakou, Georgios Sermpinis
(Resubmitted to Journal of Econometrics)*

**<font size="3">  Abstract: </font>**  <font size="3"> We introduce a novel multiple hypothesis testing method named the functional False Discovery Rate “plus” (fFDR+). The method incorporates informative covariates (and new information they carry) in estimating the False Discovery Rate (FDR) of predictive models’ “conditional” performance. In our simulation based on mutual fund returns, the fFDR+ controls well the FDR and gains considerable power over prior methods that do not account for extra information. Its advantage remains under different alpha distributions, balanced and unbalanced data structure, and cross-sectional dependent and independent error terms. It is also robust to estimation errors in the covariates. In further empirical analyses, we construct portfolios based on several covariates (five well-known and four new ones) and show that they enhance the performance of mutual fund portfolios, highlighting the value of extra information in the multiple hypothesis testing framework.

### Picking Hedge Funds with High Confidence
*with Ioannis Psaradellis, Georgios Sermpinis*

**<font size="3">  Abstract: </font>** <font size="3">  This paper introduces a new procedure to control for family error rate (FWER) in picking out-performers. The method utilizes multiple side information to more precisely estimate the FWER and gains much higher power in detecting out-performers compared to existing ones. In assessing hedge fund performance context, the new method allows investors picking out-performing funds with high confidence, that is, with very low FWER. The yearly rebalancing portfolios of hedge funds constructed by the new method with use of available covariates beat passive benchmarks in various settings. Our further experiments show that the new method detects truly out-performing hedge fund managers who can repeat their past performance over a long horizon.
